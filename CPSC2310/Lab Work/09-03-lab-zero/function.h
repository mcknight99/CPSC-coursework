/*
You are going to create a driver.c file that will call a function called printName(). I 
will provide you with a header file (.h file) that has the function prototype in it. You are required to create a 
function.c file and implement the printName function. The printName function should simply print to the 
screen, “Hello World! My name is <your name goes here>.”.
