Makefile: 

 

You are expected to provide a makefile that has a make run. 
We should be able to type make run and your program compile and run. 
The file that has the circle information defined, MUST be named input.txt the output file  be output.ppm. 
I will develop and provide to the TAâ€™s multiple input files to test your program. 
Do not change the information order of the input file. We will create our own input file to test with. 

Your program should compile with no warnings and no errors.  
If your program does not compile the highest grade you can get for the assignment will be 20.  
If your program compiles but has warnings, there could be a deduction up to 20 points.    

Your code should be well documented. (comments)  

You must have comments in the header files (.h) See instructions below 

There should be no lines of code longer than 80 characters.   

You should use proper and consistent indention.  

Here are some guide lines for documenting the code in your assignment. 
Before each function you are required to have a detailed description of what the overall function does. 
You should explain what each parameter is and what it is used for.  
/* Parameters: FILE - file pointer to the input file
               node_t - double pointer to the head of the list
 * Return:     node_t - pointer to the head of the list
 * This function starts the process of creating the list.
