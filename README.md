# CPSC-coursework
All classes I've taken and coursework, all ready to be demoed 


All of the 1070 projects were developed on Linux school servers, ssh'ed in, so many makefile commands may not be compatible with Windows users (such as clean, which uses rm).
When working locally (2120) with makefiles, I use del, which has fixed the issue for Windows, but does cause a discrepancy between 1070 and 2120 (and possible future) makefiles
