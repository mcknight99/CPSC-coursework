Hashi is a game where each island must have the amount of bridges that the island specifies.
Bridges can only travel on cardinal directions and can have 1 or 2 bridges. 
Bridges cannot cross existing bridges

Initial plans:
char 2d array to store the Hashi board
each island will be the number 1-8
a single bridge will be ' or -
a double bridge will be " or = 

When printing, it will keep the original 1-8 number in the island place
it will replace ' and " with | and

  =      2

 4=      -
  =2 3 3 -
  =      -
  3------2
 3 2 3  2
        

Plans: start with the board, pass into the solving function
the function starts by doing guaranteed moves and ignoring impossible moves (root 1-- root 1, diminished 1's are fine)
    N required bridges and N available connections to be made (ex. an 8, a 6 with 3 islands, a 4 with 2 islands, a 2 with one island, a 1 with 1 island)
    N required bridges and floor(N-1) bridges can be made (ex. a 3 with 2 islands that can each handle 2 makes one bridge to each, making the 3 a 1)
keep making guaranteed moves until there are no more guaranteed moves, then call a recursive solver to make guess moves
is a square problem a guaranteed move? -> with square problems with 2s and 1s, the 2s can fulfill the 1s. all 2s would get stuck in a loop, same with all 1s. this would get solved by the recursive solver 

recursive solver:
given a board, make a guessing move. do all guaranteed moves. If no guaranteed moves, recurse. 


I'm thinking that the solver can work by determining the "remaining" value of a island/island by subtracting existing bridges from the required count. Possible bridges can also be determined by next islands in each direction and existing bridges
