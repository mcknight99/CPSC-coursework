this is how the game works:
1. each player rolls one die (range 1 to R) and the pip count gets added to each player's pip count
2. each player then bets (separately, not a pot) based on confidence of winning from the pips 1 to R
3. then the players roll a second time and adds that roll to their pip count. 
4. steps 2 and 3 must repeat and add to the running pips and bets if there is a pip tie in the winners, the bets do not need to be raised in this case. steps 2 and 3 may repeat if the players choose to continue betting, but the bets must raise if the players choose to continue
5. once the game is over with one defined player with the most pips, each loser must forfeit an amount equal to (winner's bets/loser's bets)*(winner's pips/loser's pips)
