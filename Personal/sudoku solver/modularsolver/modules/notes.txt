Thinking back on these modules, I could have probably typedefed/structed a lot of the weird data types to make them way easier to understand.

Or even something as simple as 
typedef std::tuple<int, int, int, int, char> XVdata;
to avoid having to type 
vector<tuple<int, int, int, int, char>> XVSumData;
but instead
vector<XVdata> XVSumData;
in the puzzle mains as well

A potential overhaul/change for the future?
